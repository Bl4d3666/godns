# GodNS

A configurable attacker-in-the-middle DNS proxy for Penetration Testers and Malware Analysts, inspired by [DNSChef](https://github.com/iphelix/dnschef). It allows the selective replacement of specific DNS records for arbitrary domains with custom values, and can be used to direct traffic to a different host.
